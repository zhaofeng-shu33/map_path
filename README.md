# Introduction
This project uses data recorded by mobilephone GPS and processes it offline.

You can visualize the results by visiting:

# Technology
Indeed, you can use any tools to process the data and visualize it. Limited by my knowledge, I use `Python` programming language to preprocess the raw data, which is recorded in a txt file `gps_path_229274051_2018-12-24-07-21.txt`.
And I use BaiduMap Api to show the results.

# Concerned
GPS recording is not accurate when I am in some places (for example, when I enter the bottom of a bridge), therefore, some rows of recordings should be stripped out).

Technology is not the final purpose, I make this project to achieve other purposes.
